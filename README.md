# evChess

The aim of this project is to give Nepalese player a platform to compete and learn Chess,
so that younger generation can learn from it, and hope Nepal gets an international master
someday.


Development Plans:

1. Homepage with general news information. Login or signup button at one corner.
2. When a player create an account, they have their own dashboard.
3. The dashboard contains their past results and upcoming tournament if they have joined one.
4. Dashboard also contains Puzzle of the day and Leaderboard
5. Profiles need to be verified before they can compete in the tournament.
6. Verification is necessary because people are less likely to cheat and ruin others time and performance if they have fear of being caught.
7. Rewards section where you can redeem prize for the bonus points collected.
8. Just like Titled Tuesday, we will have Saturday Morning Blitz regularly, so that one can climb the leaderboard.

Volunteers needed because this is my pet project and I don't have budget to compensate everyone. I will have bounty added later after some progress happens.
